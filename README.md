# SOC-2022
I am Samarjeet singh. I did my soc project(competetive programing) under the metorship of Shivang tiwari. I started getting into CP after the completion of the CS101 course.And started doing problems on Codeforces. When SOC projects were announced, I knew what I wanted. These past few weeks have been an amazing and interesting learning process. I learned more things about CP and understood the previous known things at a deeper level. Shivang helped a lot during these. WHenever I was stuck on a problem or wanted to discuss some new ideas, He was always there. I plan to continue doing CP even after comnpletion of this project.
